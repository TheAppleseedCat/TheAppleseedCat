I'm an observer; for this is the best time to observe!
This planet is decent.
I'm human; it's pretty amazing!
Humans are the most fascinating creatures on Earth.
"Responsible for amazing dreams and horrible nightmares."
I believe we've done much more good than bad.
logically, in order for the progression of humankind to happen, the younger generation must be made and helped to 'know better.'
I try to remain compassionate; simply for it's existence, do I try to embrace anything that comes before me.
I spend the overwhelming majority of my time in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.
Defining intelligence doesn't mean how much you think you know; but defined as "The capability to learn." 
I've found love in the areas of Physics/Quantum physics, History, Anthropology, Geology, Astronomy and economics.
Although, there are so many fields of study in life; I could hardly wish to pick just one.
Not to mention some fields of study that have many others enveloped within. 
Between the life, the mind, the world and you, I couldn't ever dream of choosing
.. just one.
I love music with a passion of 
12 galaxies colliding.
I've been playing all sorts of strings for over 20 years, along with a multitude of other instruments that have come my way in between.

I'm more of a cat person.
Fuck Trump.

Non ducor, duco
Astra inclinant, sed non obligant
Sic semper tyrannis
Carthago delenda est
